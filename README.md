# LLM Response Classification with DeBERTa

## Project Overview
This solution implements a robust classification system using DeBERTa-v3 to evaluate and compare responses from different language models. The implementation focuses on both performance and efficiency.

## Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture
- Base Model: DeBERTa-v3-small
- Custom architecture with:
  - Dual-stream processing for response comparison
  - Multi-head attention for cross-response analysis
  - Dense layers with dropout for robust feature extraction
  - Focal Loss for handling class imbalance

### Key Features
1. **Data Processing**
   - UTF-8 encoding validation
   - Prompt-response pair concatenation
   - Strategic data augmentation with response swapping

2. **Training Strategy**
   - Mixed precision training (FP16)
   - Cross-validation with stratification
   - Cosine learning rate scheduling with warmups
   - Early stopping and model checkpointing

3. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Batch size optimization
   - Efficient sequence length handling
   - Memory-optimized data pipeline
   - Model ensemble for robust predictions

### Performance Enhancements
- Implemented parallel data processing
- Optimized batch sizes for training and inference
- Used caching for faster data access
- Efficient model checkpointing

## Model Training Details
- Sequence Length: 128 tokens
- Batch Size: 64
- Learning Rate: 1e-4 to 1e-5 (cosine decay)
